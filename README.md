✅ What I Did

- Created a Python script (`calculator.py`) that:
  - Performs basic arithmetic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
  - Accepts user input via the terminal
  - Handles input errors and division by zero
  - Loops until the user chooses to exit
- Structured the code using functions for clarity and reusability.
- (Optional) Captured a screenshot showing the calculator in use.

🛠️ Tools Used
- Python 3
- Text editor - VS Code

🧠 How It Works
- The app displays a menu of operations.
- The user selects an operation and inputs two numbers.
- The result is printed.
- The app repeats until the user chooses to exit.
